            <h2>Leslie Knope</h2>
            <p>Leslie Knope is the deputy director of the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department, and the protagonist of Parks
                and Recreation.</p>
            <p>Leslie is a passionate, hard-working and ambitious woman who loves her hometown of Pawnee and, unlike many around
                her, has not lost her optimism in the face of government bureaucracy.</p>

        <section id="Ann Perkins" style="display: none">
            <h2>Ann Perkins</h2>
            <p>Ann Perkins, Leslie's best friend, is a nurse who eventually takes a part-time position with Pawnee's department
                of public health.</p>
            <p>Ann and Leslie meet after Ann requests at a town meeting that an abandoned construction pit be filled, and Leslie
                pushes to have it turned into a park.</p>

        <section id="Tom Haverford" style="display: none">
            <h2>Tom Haverford</h2>
            <p>Tom was Leslie's immediate subordinate on the parks department and the two would often work together on tasks.
            </p>
            <p>The sarcastic Tom seemed to care little for his mid-level government job and seldom showed any initiative or
                work ethic. </p>

        <section id="Ron Swanson" style="display: none">
            <h2>Ron Swanson</h2>
            <p>Ron Swanson is the parks and recreation director, although he allows Leslie to do almost all the real work in
                the department.</p>
            <p> Despite working in a government job, Ron is a steadfast libertarian who believes in as little government as possible
                and feels the parks department should not even run or maintain parks</p>

        <section id="April Ludgate" style="display: none">
            <h2>April Ludgate</h2>
            <p>April Ludgate is the extremely sarcastic, apathetic and goth-like college student who started the show working
                as an intern in the parks and recreation department.</p>
            <p>She always speaks in a deadpan and uninterested tone of voice, often making dry comments or mocking those around
                her, and expresses little interest in her job.</p>

        <section id="Andy Dwyer" style="display: none">
            <h2>Andy Dwyer</h2>
            <p>Andy Dwyer is a goofy and dim-witted but lovable slacker who works as a shoeshiner at Pawnee city hall.</p>
            <p>He was dating Ann at the start of the show.</p>
